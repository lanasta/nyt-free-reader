This Chrome Extension will allow you to bypass the New York Times
subscription paywall and read most articles. This code does not work on
articles with a certain kind of subscription paywall by itself. Therefore,
you will be redirected to outline.com when you come across such article.
This will still let you see the full content of the article.

*Disclaimer*

- Google Chrome is required.
- This extension works after you have exhausted all
the free articles(5) on New York Times.
- You will be redirected to outline.com for articles
with subscription paywalls this code is unable to bypass.
- Use Adblock for a better experience.

Install guide:
1.Type in "chrome://extensions” to your address bar or navigate to
the Extensions page manually.
2.Turn Developer Mode on(top right corner of the page).
3.Click "Load Unpacked" and open the NYT Free Reader folder.
4.Go to https://nytimes.com to view articles.

*If you wish to switch the loading screen, simply open free-reader.js
and switch the gif url out with a link of the gif you’d like to use.
